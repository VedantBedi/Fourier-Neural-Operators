# Fourier Neural Operators for Image and Video Super-Resolution

This repository contains implementations of **Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)** for performing **super-resolution** tasks on both **images** and **videos**. The models work on grayscale and RGB inputs, using spectral convolutions in the Fourier domain to learn mappings from low-resolution to high-resolution data.
